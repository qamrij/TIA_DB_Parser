### TIA DB Parser Project Summary

#### Overview
The TIA DB Parser application is designed to interact with Siemens TIA Portal projects using the TIA Openness API. It performs the following operations:

1. **Project Discovery:**
   - Scans a specified folder for TIA Portal project files.
   - Opens projects in headless TIA Portal mode.
2. **PLC Interaction:**
   - Detects PLCs in each project.
   - Extracts specified Data Blocks (DBs) defined in a `DBs.txt` file.
3. **Comment Extraction:**
   - Processes the extracted DBs to retrieve comments associated with alarm messages.
   - Consolidates and exports comments into a structured Excel file.
4. **File Organization:**
   - Creates and organizes directories to manage exported DBs and consolidated alarm files.

#### Class Details

### **1. `Program`**
**Purpose:** Entry point for the application, orchestrating the entire workflow.

**Key Methods:**
- `Main`: Implements the primary application logic, including:
  - Initialization of the `TIA Portal` connection in headless mode.
  - Scanning for projects using `ProjectScanner`.
  - Processing each project and its PLCs with `PlcBrowser`.
  - Exporting DBs using `DBBrowser`.
  - Consolidating comments with `XMLCommentExtractor`.
  - Generating the final Excel file with `ExcelExporter`.

---

### **2. `ProjectScanner`**
**Purpose:** Handles scanning and validation of TIA Portal projects in the specified directory.

**Key Methods:**
- `ScanProjects`: Scans for `.ap[version]` files recursively in the `TiaProjects` directory and returns a list of `ProjectInfo` objects.

---

### **3. `ProjectInfo`**
**Purpose:** Represents metadata about a TIA Portal project.

**Properties:**
- `ProjectPath`: Full path to the project file.
- `ProjectName`: Name of the project.
- `LastModified`: Timestamp of the last modification.
- `IsValid`: Indicates if the project is valid for processing.
- `ValidationMessage`: Stores any validation messages.

---

### **4. `TiaPortalConnection`**
**Purpose:** Manages the connection to TIA Portal in headless mode.

**Key Methods:**
- `OpenPortal`: Launches TIA Portal without GUI and returns the connection object.
- `Dispose`: Ensures proper shutdown of the TIA Portal instance.

---

### **5. `PlcBrowser`**
**Purpose:** Interacts with PLCs in a TIA Portal project to discover and handle Data Blocks.

**Key Methods:**
- `GetAllPlcSoftwares`: Retrieves all PLC software objects in a project.
- `SelectPLC`: Allows the user to select a PLC for further processing.

---

### **6. `DBBrowser`**
**Purpose:** Searches for and exports Data Blocks (DBs) from selected PLCs.

**Key Methods:**
- `ReadDBNamesWithKeysFromFile`: Reads the `DBs.txt` file to retrieve DB names and custom keys.
- `FindDBs`: Searches for specified DBs in a PLC.
- `ExportDBsToXml`: Exports found DBs to XML format in designated directories.

---

### **7. `DBInfo`**
**Purpose:** Represents a Data Block and its metadata.

**Properties:**
- `Block`: Reference to the PLC block object.
- `DBName`: Name of the DB.
- `UDTName`: Derived name for alarm processing.
- `DBType`: Type of the DB (Global, Array, Instance).

**Key Methods:**
- `DetermineDBType`: Determines the DB type.
- `GenerateUDTName`: Generates a standardized UDT name based on DB name.

---

### **8. `XMLCommentExtractor`**
**Purpose:** Extracts alarm comments from exported DB XML files.

**Key Methods:**
- `ProcessConsolidatedComments`: Processes all DB directories to extract comments based on `DBs.txt`.
- `ExtractCommentsFromFile`: Parses a single XML file to extract alarm comments.
- `ParseDBList`: Reads and validates the `DBs.txt` file.

**Comment Processing Workflow:**
1. Open XML file.
2. Extract static sections.
3. Locate specific structures (`Alm`, `Sign`, etc.).
4. Extract relevant comments and metadata.

---

### **9. `CommentInfo`**
**Purpose:** Represents a single alarm comment.

**Properties:**
- `DB`: The DB name.
- `Structure`: Structure type (e.g., `Alm`, `Sign`).
- `SubGroup`: Subgroup name.
- `Number`: Identifier within the subgroup.
- `Name`: Concatenation of DB, Structure, SubGroup, and Number.
- `Message`: Extracted alarm message.
- `Priority`: Alarm priority (1 for `Sign`, else 0).
- `CustomKey`: Unique identifier for the comment.

---

### **10. `ExcelExporter`**
**Purpose:** Consolidates and exports extracted comments into an Excel file.

**Key Methods:**
- `ExportComments`: Writes comments into an Excel file with predefined headers and formatting.
- `ConfigureHeaders`: Configures column headers.
- `FillData`: Fills rows with comment data.

**Output File Structure:**
- Columns: `Name`, `Folder`, `Tag`, `ActivationType`, `Message`, `Priority`, etc.
- Excel file is saved in the `CompleteAlarmList` folder.

---

#### Program Workflow
1. **Project Scanning:**
   - Locate TIA Portal projects in `TiaProjects` directory.
2. **DB Export:**
   - Open each project, process PLCs, and export target DBs.
3. **Comment Extraction:**
   - Consolidate comments from all DBs into a single Excel file.
4. **Directory Structure:**
   - Organized into `Exports` folder with subfolders for DBs and comments.
5. **Output:**
   - `CompleteAlarmList` folder contains a consolidated Excel file with all comments.

---

### Key Characteristics
- Modular design with reusable classes for project scanning, PLC interaction, DB processing, and comment extraction.
- Robust handling of errors during TIA Portal connection and file processing.
- Flexible configuration through `DBs.txt` for specifying target DBs.
