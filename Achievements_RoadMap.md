### Comprehensive Step-by-Step Plan for Application Enhancements

### Phase 1: Project Discovery and TIA Portal Management
1. Implement Project Discovery:
   - [X] Create mechanism to scan specified folder for TIA Portal projects
   - [X] Create queue/list of projects to process
   - [X] Validate project files

2. Implement TIA Portal Instance Management:
   - [X] Launch TIA Portal in headless mode
   - [X] Add proper startup/shutdown handling
   - [X] Implement project opening/closing mechanism
   - [X] Add error handling and recovery

### Phase 2: Enhanced Processing Flow
1. Project Processing:
   - [X] Process one project at a time
   - [X] Automatically discover all PLCs in current project
   - [X] Track Project-PLC relationships

2. DB Search and Export:
   - [X] Search for target DBs (from DBs.txt) across all PLCs
   - [X] Track which DBs were found in which PLC/Project
   - [X] Export found DBs to appropriate folders
   - [X] Implement proper error handling for DB operations

### Phase 3: Directory Structure Management
1. Implement Directory Structure:
   - [X] Create base timestamp directory for execution
   - [X] Create project-specific folders only for projects where DBs were found
   - [X] Create PLC-specific folders with ExportedDBs subfolder
   - [X] Create single ExportedComments folder at base level
   - [ ] Add CompleteAlarmList folder for consolidated output

2. Path Management:
   - [X] Create dedicated path management class
   - [X] Handle path generation and validation
   - [X] Provide methods to access necessary paths

### Phase 4: Comment Processing
1. Enhance Comment Extraction:
   - [ ] Process DBs from all projects/PLCs
   - [ ] Ensure all directories in ExportedDBs are processed
   - [ ] Consolidate comments from all sources

2. Excel Export:
   - [ ] Generate single consolidated Excel file
   - [ ] Include project/PLC source information
   - [ ] Place in CompleteAlarmList folder

### Phase 5: Error Handling and Logging
1. Implement Comprehensive Error Handling:
   - [X] Handle TIA Portal connection issues
   - [X] Handle project access errors
   - [X] Handle DB export failures
   - [X] Implement recovery mechanisms

2. Add Logging:
   - [X] Log all operations
   - [X] Track processing status
   - [X] Record any errors or warnings
   - [X] Create execution summary
